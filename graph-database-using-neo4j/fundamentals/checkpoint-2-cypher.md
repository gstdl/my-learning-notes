# Cypher

## Introduction

Cypher is the query language you use to retrieve data from the Neo4j Database.

After reading this article, you are expected to understand how to:

- Retrieve nodes from the graph.
  - Retrieve nodes with a particular label.
  - Filter the retrieval by a property value.
  - Return property values.
- Retrieve nodes and relationships from the graph using patterns in the graph.
- Filter queries

## Data Model

The examples shown in this article will be using the data model shown in the image below.

## Elements of A Cypher query

- Nodes are represented by parentheses `()`
  - The label of the node is specified by a colon `:` followed by the label name. For example, `(:Movie)`
  - Nodes can be given an alias by specifying the alias before the colon `:`. Example: `(m:Movie)`
  - Filtering node properties can be done by specifying a property name and a value to match in JSON like syntax. Example: `(m:Movie {title: "The Matrix"})`
- Relationships between nodes are written with two dashes, for example `(:Person)--(:Movie)`.
  - The direction of a relationship is indicated using a greater than or less than symbol `<` or `>` , for example `(:Person)-â†’(:Movie)`
  - The type of the relationship is written using the square brackets between the two dashes: `[` and `]`, for example `[:ACTED_IN]`
  - Similar to nodes, filtering on properties are done by specifying a property name and a value to match in a JSON like syntax. Example: `[:ACTED_IN{year:2020}]`
  - By default the depth defined in traversal will be 1. However, this behavior can be overwritten by writting a star followed by the depth you are expecting afer the relationship type. Examples:
    - `[:ACTED_IN*2]` (traverse for depth = 2)
    - `[:ACTED_IN*..4]` (traverse for depth between 0 and 4)
    - `[:ACTED_IN*2..]` (traverse for depth larger than 2)
    - `[:ACTED_IN*..10]` (traverse for depth less than 10)
    - `[:ACTED_IN*]`  (traverse for unlimited depth)

A simple cypher query will look like this:

```cypher
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Cloud Atlas'})<-[:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person)
RETURN p.name
```

The query above will return the name of Person's who acted in the Movie titled Cloud Atlas.

## Clauses in Cypher

### Clauses for reading data

In the cypher query sample above, you've seen the clause `MATCH` and `RETURN`. But what does those clauses do? The list below will explore the clauses in cypher and what does each keyword do.

- `MATCH` retrieve node(s)
- `RETURN` return the specified after the clause (In the cypher query sample above it returns the person's name). This behavior is similar to SQL's `SELECT` clause
- `WHERE` filter node/relationships based on their properties and/or relationship/graph directions. Other clauses which usually follows the `WHERE` clause includes:
  - `IS`
  - `NOT` converts a `TRUE` statement to `FALSE` and vice versa
  - `NULL` null
  - `AND` logical and operator
  - `OR` logical or operator
  - `STARTS WITH` used to filter strings starting with certain characters seqeunce
  - `ENDS WITH` used to filter strings ending with certain characters seqeunce
  - `CONTAINS` used to filter strings containing certain characters seqeunce
  - `IN` checks if an entity is in an list
  - and many more

### Clauses for writing data

#### Create Node/Relationships

- `CREATE` creates a node/relationship
- `MERGE` creates a node/relationship while avoiding creating duplicates.
   A cypher query using the `MERGE` clause to **create a node** will look like this:
   ```cypher
   MERGE (p:Person {name: 'Michael Cain'})
   ```
   Optionally, you can return the newly created node by adding the `RETURN` clause to the query. For example:
   ```cypher
   MERGE (p:Person {name: 'Michael Cain'})
   RETURN p
   ```
   A cypher query using the `MERGE` clause to **create nodes and relationships between them** will look like this:
   ```cypher
   MERGE (p:Person {name: 'Emily Blunt'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie {title: 'A Quiet Place'})
   RETURN p, m
   ```

The clause to read data can also be chained with the clauses for creating node/relationships such as:

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name = "Daniel Kaluuya"
MERGE (m:Movie{title:"Get Out"})
MERGE (p)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
```

#### Updating properties

In the section above you've seen how to create a node property on creation. But what about updating a property of a node that already exists?

In order to do that cypher uses the `SET` clause.

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Michael Cain' AND m.title = 'The Dark Knight'
SET r.roles = ['Alfred Penny'], r.year = 2008
RETURN p, r, m
```

or

```cypher
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Get Out'})
SET m.tagline = "Gripping, scary, witty and timely!", m.released = 2017
RETURN m.title, m.tagline, m.released
```

#### Removing Properties

There 2 ways to remove a property. First, is by using the `REMOVE` clause.

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Michael Cain' AND m.title = 'The Dark Knight'
REMOVE r.roles
RETURN p, r, m
```

Next, is by setting the property to `null`

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name = 'Gene Hackman'
SET p.born = null
RETURN p
```

#### Conditional Property Updating

Up to this point, you've seen how to create a node along with it's properties and updating a node's properties. 

However, there are other cases where you want to create only certain node properties during node creation or update the node properties if it already exist. Enter, the `ON CREATE SET` and `ON MATCH SET` clauses. When a `MERGE` clause is followed by an `ON CREATE SET` clause, it will only create the properties defined after the `ON CREATE SET`. Following the whole cypher query with the `ON MATCH SET` will update the properties only when the node already exists in the database.

```cypher
// Find or create a person with this name
MERGE (p:Person {name: 'McKenna Grace'})

// Only set the `createdAt` property if the node is created during this query
ON CREATE SET p.createdAt = datetime()

// Only set the `updatedAt` property if the node was created previously
ON MATCH SET p.updatedAt = datetime()

// Set the `born` property regardless
SET p.born = 2006

RETURN p
```

#### Deleting Node/Relationships

To delete nodes/relationships, there are 2 clauses.

- `DELETE`
  - Node deletion
    ```cypher
    MATCH (p:Person)
    WHERE p.name = 'Jane Doe'
    DELETE p
    ```
  - Relationship deletion
    ```cypher
    MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Jane Doe'})-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie {title: 'The Matrix'})
    DELETE r
    RETURN p, m
    ```
- `DETACH DELETE` Deletes one or multiple node(s) along with all relationships connected to that node
  ```cypher
  MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Jane Doe'}) DETACH DELETE p
  ```
  or the following cypher query to delete all nodes in the database:
  ```cypher
  MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n
  ```
